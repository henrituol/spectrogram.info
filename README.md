# spectrogram.info â€“ Learn to read spectrograms of audio signals

This is my first excursion into the world of JavaScript.
I wanted to keep this simple, hence, there are only JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

This web application teaches you to read **spectrogram** images.


"A spectrogram is a visual representation of the spectrum of frequencies of a signal as it varies with time." [(source.)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrogram) 

The final version of this web application includes the following sections:
1. Introduction to sound and its visualization. (Text, images, and animation.)
2. What is a spectrogram? (Text, images, and animation.)
3. Multiple choice quiz: connect what you hear with the corresponding image. (Audio, images, and checkboxes for choices.)

At the moment, development is focused on creating the first version of the quiz section.

Idea of the game:
- Listen to an audio sample. (First version of the game includes birds and grasshoppers.)
- Click A, B, or C, i.e. the image corresponding the sample.
- Show the result. Green if correct and red if wrong.
- Show next set of images and audio by clicking "next".

All the sound files and images are fetched from https://xeno-canto.org/ 

You can try out the quiz here: [http://spectrogram.info/](https://spectrogram.info/)
